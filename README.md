# Noodl Cloud Service

Welcome to the Noodl Cloud Service project! In this repository, you can find the Self-Hosted Noodl Cloud Service.

This contains an NPM package making it easy to create a custom version on top of the Noodl Cloud Service.

There is also a Docker image making it easy to set up and host the normal Self-Hosted Noodl Cloud Service.

## Getting Started

This project is using `isolated-vm` to execute each Cloud Function in isolation from the other Cloud Functions.

Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Mac or Windows. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

After installing docker install Git if not already installed on your system.

Here I am providing commands for seting up Git on Ubuntu because that is what I use
```
sudo apt install git -y
```
After Git is installed clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/noodlapp/noodl-cloudservice.git
```

CD to the folder created by above command.
```
cd ./noodl-cloudservice/
```

Edit the file docker-compose.yml and change the values of:
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
- MASTER_KEY
- APP_ID

Also change the `DATABASE_URI` to reflect the username and password that you have changed in above step.

Run in this directory to build and run the Cloud Service with a MongoDB instance:

```shell
docker compose up
```

The Cloud Service will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
